***    Welcome to the exciting world of Black Jack! Here's your comprehensive guide to playing the game:         ***
***                                                                                                              ***
***    Black Jack, also known as 21, is a classic card game that's easy to learn but difficult to master.        ***
***    The objective is simple: beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.                                    ***
***                                                                                                              ***
***    To start, each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards. In most variations, the dealer's         ***
***    first card is dealt face-up, while the second card is dealt face-down. All cards are worth their          ***
***    face value, except for face cards (Jack, Queen, King), which are each worth 10 points, and Aces,          ***
***    which can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player the most.          ***
***                                                                                                              ***
***    After receiving your initial two cards, you have several options:                                         ***
***                                                                                                              ***
***    Hit: Request another card to increase your hand total. You can continue to hit until you're               ***
***    satisfied with your hand or until you exceed 21 points, resulting in a bust.                              ***
***    Stand: Decide to keep your current hand and end your turn. This is typically done when you're             ***
***    satisfied with your hand and believe it's strong enough to beat the dealer.                               ***
***    Double Down: Double your original bet and receive only one additional card. This option is usually        ***
***    chosen when a player believes they have a strong chance of winning with just one more card.               ***
***    Split: If your initial two cards are of the same rank (e.g., two 7s or two Queens), you have the          ***
***    option to split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet. Additional cards are then            ***
***    dealt to each hand, and you play them separately.                                                         ***
***    Surrender: In some variations of the game, players may have the option to surrender, forfeiting           ***
***    half of their bet and ending the hand immediately.                                                        ***
***    Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card. The dealer          ***
***    must then hit until they reach a total of 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.   ***
***    If the dealer doesn't bust, the player with a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer's wins.             ***
***    In the case of a tie, it's a push, and the player's bet is returned.                                      ***
***                                                                                                              ***
